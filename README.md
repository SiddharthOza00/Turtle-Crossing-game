# Turtle-Crossing-game
Basic turtle crossing game with python using PyCharm


The goal of this game is to reach the finish line without geting hit by a car.
The only way is Up, you cannot go back.
Each time you successfully reach the finish line, the level increases hence the speed of cars increase.
But if you get hit by a car it's Game Over and you progess resets.
You have to run the program again to play the game again.


#Requirements to Run the code
1)You need python 3.9 or above interpreter.
2)I have used PyCharm to develop this game.
